Installation notes:

These are some notes on installing Wiki Voter Guide on a fresh system.
These are not step by step instructions, just an outline of what is
needed. You'll need to think. 

Install Wiki-Voter-Guide:

git clone http://github.com/ecitizenry/Wiki-Voter-Guide.git

cp -R wvg /var/www/wvg/
mkdir /var/www/wvg/wvg/python_egg_cache
chmod go+w /var/www/wvg/wvg/python_egg_cache 

(You may need to do something more intelligent than making the 
egg cache world writable depending on your local environment
and security issues.) 

Install Python-Votesmart:

git clone http://github.com/sunlightlabs/python-votesmart.git
python setup.py install

Install webpy:

git clone http://github.com/webpy/webpy.git
python setup.py install

Install Apache Mod_WSGI:

yum install mod_wsgi

Configure the VoteSmart API key:

Wiki Voter Guide needs a cryptographic key to access the Project
VoteSmart API. You can obtain a key at the link below. It needs
to be placed in the python-wvg configuration file.

Configure Apache: (ymmv)

echo 'Include /var/www/wvg/wvg/conf/apache-wvg.conf' >> /var/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

You might need to edit apache-wvg.conf and set the VirtualHost directive
to "*" instead of 127.0.0.1:8081
